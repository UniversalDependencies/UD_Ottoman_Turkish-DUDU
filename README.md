# Summary

An Ottoman Turkish dependency treebank annotated in UD style. Created by Enes Yılandiloğlu.


# Introduction

This project comprises 84 sentences that are firstly automaticaly annotated via machamp (Van der Goot et al., 2021). During the training phase, multiple modern Turkish UD treebanks were used.
and then manually corrected in a systematic way. Randomly shuffled sentences were written between 14th to 20th century in various genres
such as fiction, news, article, registry record, and religious preach. Unfortunately, for this version, the genres can not be told apart by sentence ids. The order of the sentences is chronology based rather than genre based, the earliest written sentence is at the top.
In this treebank, [Ottoman Turkish transcription alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Turkish_alphabet) is used.


# Acknowledgments
